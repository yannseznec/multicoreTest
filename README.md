Test patches for attempting to use multiple cores of a raspberry pi for Pure Data using the pd~ object.

on the command line, i'm attempting to run the "multiTest.pd" file like so:
pd -nogui multiTest.pd

Pd launches and it gives me the message "pd~ version 0.54" but there is no sound.

Running only the subpatch (rand_osc.pd) produces the sine tone as expected.
